It's time to combine some more of those points we've been stockpiling.
first, let's take a given truth.
- Gaster is in DELTARUNE in some form
Then, what we've just discussed:
- W.D. Gaster is an avatar of toby fox
Finally, we combine those with any or all of the following:
- In its original form, DELTARUNE was a dream
- Toby Fox has the intent to perserve what he saw in the dream
- In DELTARUNE, you take the role that Toby Fox experienced in the original DELTARUNE
Given these understandings, we can easily understand something about the main story of the game.
Particularly, that it is impossible for Gaster to make an appearance. It is impossible for an element that did not exist in the original DELTARUNE to determine major details of the main route of its adaptation. Toby Fox has clearly stated his intent to depict what he saw at the end of the dream, and what he saw must lack Gaster, so Gaster must not be present through the conclusion of the game as it was originally intended to be experienced.
The dream could not have had gaster, and as Toby Fox was in the role of the player, he could not have also been Gaster.
The shadow crystals and Snowgrave stretch the rules. It would not be out of the question for him to make an appearance or be relevant in there, but mark my words that neither he will nor his direct influence will appear to those who treat the common path.
At the very, very least, Gaster will have no part in what Toby Fox saw at the end of the original DELTARUNE. he simply couldn't have, if he is an intentional avatar of the person that was the dreamer.
[He might offer something incredible to us if you chase him down. An illuminating distortion.]

Oh, just remembered, apparently Gaster also speaks to you on the game over screen.
Whether you call that optional content or not is,
well,
I'm not here to judge, but I've never seen it.
