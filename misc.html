Freedom. The ability to exist somewhere without constraints.
The observer is constrained by Kris. Kris is constrained by the observer.
You are mutually bound. If the strings were cut, the game would simply end, and you would wake up.
As for what would happen to Kris?
It's impossible for us to know. There's no way to both incite and observe it.
The heaven Spamton sees is what everyone has except the observer and Kris.
You can have it too, if you close the game.

And,

"The edge of the shadow, where reality and dream meet."
Is that convergence point not DELTARUNE itself? The dream made real? An artifact from the world of the night, made physical by Fangamer?
"AT "SHADOW'S EDGE," SHATTER THE TWILIGHT REVERIE."
What do you call a reverie? The mourning the morning brings, the loss of the dream? The shadow creeps away from your face as the sun bursts through the curtains; how do you intend to shatter that?

And,

Skeletons are what's left after humans die.
But is surely just sophistry, Chara is enough of a problem on their own.

And,

To control Noelle may be the greatest kindness you know how to offer Kris.
When all is said and done, you can only really control one protagonist at a time.
