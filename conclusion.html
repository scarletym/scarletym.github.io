<div id="howtocenteradiv"><span id="main">There it is.
The series of deductions I have made regarding UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE.

Of course, to you, this may be an apparent cop-out.
After all, what is there that I would be unable to get away with by declaring it to be a functionality of dream mechanics?
The "it was all a dream" trope is disliked for a reason.
I do not intend to further substantiate myself on this point, although I am certain of it. You may disagree.
As you might have guessed, this website exists as an "I told you so" more than anything else.
I would be delighted for the rest of the game to release and line up perfectly with my metaphorical decompilation, but I would be ever so much more delighted to be the only person to have provenly known that it would do so in advance.
This website, in its release form, will be perserved on archive.org immediately for these purposes.
I provide evidence for the purpose of furthering my claim to this prophecy, and whether anyone is convinced of it or not at the moment is fine.
The hope is that my substantiated parts will be great enough that if my unsubstantiated parts are also validated, they will be seen as having done so through more than sheer luck.
Can you tell I enjoy my vanity?

This is very intentionally being archived before DELTARUNE chapter two releases, but I may update it later. We'll see what's made more clear by the big release.
Truth be told, this is not fully comprehensive of my studies, but I am pressed to publish it in this state given time and articulatory constraints.

If you have any further knowledge, questions, or are Toby Fox ready to give me my plaque of prophetic awesomeness, please email <a href="mailto:wassup@my-deltarune-theory.xyz">wassup@my-deltarune-theory.xyz.</a>
