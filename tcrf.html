Now, the following proposition is poorly evidenced and more of a meta-analysis, but I would like to pose it even if it is anecdotal.
This game has taken a very long time to develop. It has already taken more time than Toby Fox stated he would be comfortable with for the entirety of development, and only two chapters are yet released.
I am a game developer with a very large personal project ongoing, with past projects completed. Coincidentally, I work in the same engine DELTARUNE is being made in! It may be a trick of the mind, but I feel as if I notice something noteworthy about the snowgrave route with regards to the cycle of game development.
At least, for what exists in chapter two, it is easy.

I do not mean to disparage the effort Toby Fox put into making it, as it is certainly finely crafted and with fewer bugs than I have ever released a game with, but it is not something that, I feel, necessitates a large amount of development time in comparison to other things.
It does not add any unique enemies or bosses, only modifies a few that already exist.
It does not introduce any new areas, and the iceshock mechanic is on the more simple side.
Having looked through a bit of DELTARUNE's codebase, I don't envy the process of cutscene-making, but it's still a generally efficient thing to have made.

Again, I say this not to insult. I think being able to recycle content in a way players enjoy is a wonderful thing, and I have personally seen much milage out of easy-to-implement features, but it further leads me down the idea that snowgrave is a peripheral experience, incited by what I still do not know, but not the one Toby Fox initially set out to make.
Needless to say, the lack of anything similar in chapter one and the very large gap in time between chapter one and two reinforces this theory to me. <span id="secret">I am exceedingly interested in the reasoning behind the inclusion of the snowgrave route if it is for any other reason than "having a funny idea".</span>

Hence all of that, I maintain that there are not just two but three routes.
It may be possible for the shadow crystal route to reconvene with the main route before the ending, but it will invoke substantial differences. <span id="secret">I hope the routes do not reconverge.</span>

<span id="less">That all being said, the shadow crystal route is the one that will meet with much Gaster-related phonomena at some point. This does not pose issues with the fact that DELTARUNE is an adaptation, because the shadow crystals did not exist in the original DELTARUNE. They are a 'ficticious' addition Toby Fox has added.</span>
I feel as if this is a wise idea. Well, more like "super awesome". While Gaster stuff might not be important for conveying the original DELTARUNE Toby Fox saw back then, I would still be very happy to see what he does with it. I've read a lot of Gaster interpretations over the years, and am excited to see what the real thing is like. <span id="secret">I will try to keep my expectations in check.</span>
