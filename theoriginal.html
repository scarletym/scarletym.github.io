Toby Fox has stated that the idea for DELTARUNE originated from a dream he once had.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, especially since we have been provided an example of very old development ideas that still correlate to the DELTARUNE we know today.
It has been stated that at the end of the dream, Toby saw something so incredible that he has relentlessly pursued depicting it since.
I do not know what that thing is.
However, we can infer certain qualities about the entirety of DELTARUNE with conviction using this knowledge.

Most notably, I can declare the first very important piece of information that the rest of this theory follows from.
The video game DELTARUNE is an adaptation of the original DELTARUNE.

I will henceforth be referring to the dream that Toby saw as "the original DELTARUNE", and the game as DELTARUNE, to alleiviate any confusion. These are two seperate things with distinct differences.
