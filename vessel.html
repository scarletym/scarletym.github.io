<div id="howtocenteradiv"><span id="main">The character creator, vessel creator, gonermaker, however it should be called, is an unavoidable, lengthy segment at the start of DELTARUNE.
I do not believe that it runs contrarily to the theories I have and will continue to pose.
Given Kris' whole abscence, I consider it to be something seperate from DELTARUNE. The "survey program", if you must.
The truth is that it is simply incompatible with DELTARUNE.

The character creator is the vision for an ideal world where one does not need to claim another as a vessel to exist within the dream of the original DELTARUNE.
One where an observer can exist freely without the need to burden another.
You would set Kris free from your troubles the moment you had the option to control a doll, wouldn't you?
[Personally, I think it's a more selfish thing than a selfless one. More than stopping Kris' freedom, you would like to be free yourself, right?]
But the rules of the dream don't allow for it, at least not as they were applied in the original DELTARUNE.
Similarly, anyone who plays games would know that having a truly independent protagonist that isn't bound to a 'character' in some way is practically impossible for most games. In a pure sandbox like Minecraft, anything goes, but the moment you add a cutscene you need someone to represent you, because developers can't let you just type at NPCs (generative AI isn't real and doesn't count).
As much as I, you, or Toby Fox would want otherwise, nobody can choose who they are in that world.
