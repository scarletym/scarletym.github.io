<div id="howtocenteradiv"><span id="main">When you meet Sans for the first time in chapter one, you can say "it's great to see you again".
Sans has no idea what you're talking about. I would wager, neither does Kris.
It is something possible because of you, the observer, and your familiarity with the shape of Sans.
But you mistake the shape for the truth, and call out blithely. [It is because that is not the true shape.]
These assumptions are destructive, a defect of the observer.
[These defects may be waived in the future. You may see that the shape changes.]
I surmise that the cast of DELTARUNE is entirely different from the cast of UNDERTALE. I mean not just that they have different histories, but that they are wholly different.\
You expect them to be the same, and respond to Sans in that way.
(Note that Sans may be excepted from this, although the effect is the same)
Although they appear physically similar at the present time, they are more different than is immediately understandable.
If Toby Fox ideated UNDERTALE before DELTARUNE, this difference will become very apparent in the main route of DELTARUNE.
If he did not, this difference will only be apparent on the shadow crystal and/or snowgrave routes.
It is very important to Toby Fox that you play UNDERTALE before DELTARUNE. This assumption is one he expects you to be compulsed by your experience to make.

And to note.
Given Sans' odd situation, it's possible that he is actually the same person between both games. This would be a unique case but does not affect the actual application of this idea as the concept of Sans, and the others, being more familiar than he should be is the issue.
