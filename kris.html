<div id="howtocenteradiv"><span id="main">There is one final case to note regarding the analagibility of UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE's game-to-dream mechanics.

I will provide this final exception and my explanation for it, but you may decide that my explanation is insufficient.
There are a few strings floating around somewhere in the data.win of both chapter one and two that are the speech of someone seemingly lost in darkness.
I maintain that this is Kris's voice, the only time we are able to hear them directly.
However, unused strings are inconsolable with any dream mechanics, regardless of how abstract you may consider them.
This is a contradiction that is capable of resolving itself, supposing those strings get used in later chapters.
Well. Aside from the fact that some of the text is dredged up by Spamton briefly. (The actual string is not used, it is a reimplementation of the same text.)
Spamton himself is Gaster-related, and speaking to him at his shop to find that dialogue is a step in getting a shadow crystal. Given the nature of the shadow crystal route, which will be later elaborated on, I am willing to consider these strings components of Gaster, and thus, not an issue when considering the nature of the adaptation.

There are further things to mention regarding Kris, but they are not pertinent.
I have ambled so far so that I may clearly and distinctively make my next point, one that offers insight into the nature of Doctor Gaster.
Rather, it is <a href="gaster.html">his whole nature itself.</a>
