In UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE, the vast majority of all text is prefixed with an asterisk.
The notable exceptions are anything said by Papyrus and any text said when near a dark fountain.
Most battle dialogue also doesn't have it, and while that feels more like a stylization than anything else, it still worries me.
This part of the "theory" is really just blathering. I can't corroberate any of this much, but you're welcome to listen.

<span id="dim">Suppose, all asterisk text is 'improvised' rather than quoted. Like a footnote? Toby Fox rarely has direct dialogue from the original DELTARUNE and uses this to signal creative liberty?
That would be ridiculous given how much Papyrus is capable of speaking in every single room in UNDERTALE, but feels appropriate in the ways of Gaster being exempt and memorable moments like dark fountains lacking it.
Maybe.
There's a flower called an "aster", although "aster" itself means "star".</span>

What's up with that, right?

Aside from that, Papyrus and Sans are weird in general, although this is <a href="https://birdsareblooming.tumblr.com/181600359848/blink-motherfucker-an-essay-of-papyrus-battle">very publicly known.</a>
I have speculation as to Papyrus' properties, but nothing I can find enough reason or evidence for.
I consider this a substantial weakness of mine, but, well, can't win 'em all.
It's easy to say that Sans crossed over from DELTARUNE, but what does that mean for the original DELTARUNE? <span id="secret">The original UDNERTALE? Can that exist?</span>
