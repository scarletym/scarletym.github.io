<div id="howtocenteradiv"><span id="main">- Doctor Gaster -

I have spoken at length about the doc so far, but I have not given any details as to his actual nature, save for all game-exclusive meta phonomena being exclusive to him.
I am very confident in my assessment of his nature.
W.D. Gaster is a representation of Toby Fox himself.
It is the form of the adjustments he gave to the adaptation.
<span id="less">It is the form that has been stripped away from the original DELTARUNE to make space for the player, the one who no longer exists in the worlds but are fundamental to them.</span>
He is a man who speaks no longer with words, but only in hands as he types away at the functionality of the games.
Aha. If you'd permit the sophistry.
Gaster must not show up in the main route of DELTARUNE. He, and all of his associated phonomena that relate to UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE being made in GameMaker Studio 1.4 and 2.3, are incorrigible to the shape of the original dream.

I find that this understanding makes understanding everything Gaster does and doesnt do much simpler. It's Occam's Razor, to a point.
The way Gaster speaks on Twitter, the character creation of DELTARUNE, the obscurity of the encounters, nearly all of it.
Two fascinating questions arise from accepting this, though.
First, damn dude, you already had a funny dog, and you got another self-insert? Aye yai yai.
Second, Gaster's history in UNDERTALE's underground.
<span id="less">The 'core' 'exists' because of "Gaster's" 'work', which is a phrase clearly not benefitting from the Occam's Razor I claimed to have.</span>

<span id="less">Is it that UNDERTALE is 'ficticious' and Gaster's role in it is metaphorical? Perhaps that UNDERTALE is an adaptation of a second dream Toby Fox experienced following the original DELTARUNE, and Gaster is the role Toby Fox took within it; thus, Frisk is 'ficticious'?</span>
I struggle to make much sense of it, and my own ideas seem ridiculous to me, but I feel as if I must offer something.
<span id="secret">Instead, is UNDERTALE not 'ficticious' but 'artificial'?</span>
Did he "fall into" his greatest work?
I'm unsure.
However, I am only unsure about that small portion of this proposition, and have no issue saying with confidence that in general Gaster is Toby Fox's own self.

It is also worth mentioning that Gaster makes plenty appearances outside the game, speaking directly through the game's Twitter on occasion. You know, like, Toby's account?

What you have read is the main sum of the theory I intend to present. The portion that I believe is fully and transparently substantiated.
But if you'd allow.
I have a few more miscellaneous things to mention.
Now that the groundwork has been established, feel free to proceed to the <a href="contents.html">table of contents.</a>
