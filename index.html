<div id="howtocenteradiv"><span id="main">Good evening.

With this website, I intend to do the following:
- Prove a certain few facts about DELTARUNE in the most empiric way I am able
- Suppose a certain few ideas about DELTARUNE that follow the logic
- Apply conjecture to DELTARUNE that I do not intend to substantiate but stand behind the same
- Pose questions about UNDERTALE

At the outset, I will declare that I am wholly uninterested in thematic correlations and subsequent positing. What I intend to present does not acknowledge the value of metaphor or symbolism, although occasionally it will attempt to extract literalisms from the ones already present.
More than anything else, I am concerned with deliminating what is possible and what is impossible within the logic of the world of DELTARUNE.

I do not know who the knight is. I do not know what is in the bunker. I do not know what will be in chapters three four, five, or six, and only scarcely know what is in seven.
I will say, as well, that this theory is predicated on trust in Toby Fox, his lead position in the development of DELTARUNE, and his word. If it turns out he has spoken a trick or two, or has, for some reason, abdicated creative control, then this all falls apart.

As a guide, text used in this theory will indicate how substantiated I believe it is. I personally stand behind all of it, however.

This is text that I believe I have presented the full range of evidence necessary to reasonably consider, or is just my usual speaking tone.
<span id="less">This is text that I do not believe should be readily accepted given what I offer to support it, but may still be worth considering.</span>
<span id="dim">This is text you may consider poorly-based.</span>
<span id="secret">This is text I do not intend to explain.</span>

Now then.
