<div id="howtocenteradiv"><span id="main">About those incompatibilities.
Despite what I had said about the veracity of the adaptation, there are several.
However, they all have one thing in common.

All nonanalogizable game-specific phonomena are related to Doctor Gaster.
Comb through UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE, and this will wholly be the case. From fun values to abc_123a.ogg to character creation and more, it's all the doc.
I do not have an exhaustive list prepared, nor do I intend to detail why certain things are Gaster-related, because much of it is common knowledge. Gaster's presence in the character creator only slightly less immediate to acknowledge as Chara being the source of narration.

Notably, all of these Gaster-events in both UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE are optional, usually wholly hidden.
It is possible to pass through both fully, completing a perfect dream-adjacent run, without encountering them.
Although there are three points that are pretty close, those being:
- The river person is pretty easy to find, and they're able to mention a man who speaks in hands sometimes during the boat ride
- Spamton must be fought to progress in chapter two. This encounter is hard unavoidable without glitches
- And this is more speculation than anything else, but I've considered that Gaster is the "high-class-client" mentioned in the music shop, although it may be a stretch
I consider the Spamton one the most troubling given that it is heavily implied that Spamton only acts the way he does because of Gaster-related interference, making touching a consequence of that interference necessary to progress the game.
I can't debate its existence. Whether you consider that too severe of an infraction to the theory to accept it is up to you.
The river person is also capable of using current_weekday to determine the day from your computer clock. I'm unsure of how seriously to take that.

I consider the optionality to be important, because it is impossible that inconsolably game-specific phonomena were encountered by Toby Fox in the original DELTARUNE.
A path to the end of the game must exist where none of these are encountered, because otherwise the experience of going through it fully would no longer be comparable to that of going through the original DELTARUNE.

With the preamble done and the minor exceptions acknowledged, I will now consider <a href="vessel.html">the major exception.</a>
