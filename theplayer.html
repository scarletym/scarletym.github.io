Understanding, now, that the original DELTARUNE was Toby Fox's dream, we are left with an issue of analogy.
DELTARUNE is a game that exhibits mechanics for which no analogue can be found in other mediums.
There are many of these to note. SAVE and LOAD, Gaster's character creation scene, the choices the player is able to make, and most concerning of all to DELTARUNE at the moment, the presence of the player themselves.
But, we depart from the original DELTARUNE not adapting from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xWa-HHr3sg">another medium</a> (feel free to listen as you read), but from a dream.
I will mention more of the analogies employed later, but I'd like to take extra note first of the player.
The original DELTARUNE, not being a game, must not have a player at all.

However, I think any will agree that the supposition of a DELTARUNE that lacks the player is ridiculous. You are imparative to Kris' current existence.
Thus, a being must have existed in the original DELTARUNE that acted as a 'player'.
This is not a difficult being to find. By necessity, Toby Fox is the original 'player', who experienced the original DELTARUNE with analagous caveats, relationships, and troubles that we do in DELTARUNE.

The parallel for "the characters knowing they are seen in a game" is "the characters knowing they are seen in a dream".
Instead of running in a window, it was seen in a rest. instead of a player, a dreamer.
<span id="less">I believe there are no instances in either game that demands that it be a computer-programmed executable, putting aside the doctor for a moment. I will return to that issue.</span>

And I mean this in no uncertain terms; it is an adapation, not a port. A localization, not a translation.
Concessions have been made, but the spirit of the original surely shines through.
Well, more than concessions, I must imagine. I would believe that large parts of the game and important characters are 'fictitious' within the scope of the adaptation, not appearing in the original DELTARUNE or with improvizations made to make DELTARUNE a better game. I don't doubt Toby Fox's creativity or ability to create well-structured and compelling stories in the abscence of a dream as source material.
Stepping back slightly, the fact that it is an adaptation is why the difference between the meta components that refer to the game as a game and the meta components that NECESSITATE it being a game stand out so strongly to me.

As this is a major commonality between the original DELTARUNE and DELTARUNE I will refer to the bring that shares a body with Kris as "the observer". In the case of the original DELTARUNE, it is Toby Fox. In the case of DELTARUNE, it is the player.

Now, if this is satisfactory, <a href="incompatibilities.html">onward we go.</a>
